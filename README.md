# multiwavelength-zernike

This repository accompanies the paper 'Adding colour to the Zernike wavefront sensor: Advantages of including multi-wavelength measurements for wavefront reconstruction'. (Darcis et al. 2025)

The 'plot' scripts reproduce the figures of the paper. The 'sim' scripts generate new datasets similar to those used for the paper. Due to differences in random seeds there might be some slight variations but these do not change the conclusions.
